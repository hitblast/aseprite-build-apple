## Why

Aseprite is a powerful tool for creating pixel art and animations, and as a hobby, I've been doing pixel art for quite a while. However, building it on my MacBook was a challenging process. Thus, I've made this script which aims to simplify the build process by automating all of the steps, requiring little to no manual input.

## Requirements

> [!NOTE]
> The script has been successfully tested with **macOS Tahoe 26**.

- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
- [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/)
- [libyaml](https://github.com/yaml/libyaml)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

If you want to install the dependencies, use this Homebrew command:

```bash
brew install libyaml cmake ninja git
```

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
# Clone using git.
git clone https://github.com/hitblast/aseprite-build-apple.git
```

2. Run the script:

```bash
# Change directory to the script.
cd aseprite-build-apple

# Make the script executable.
chmod +x build.sh

# Run the script.
./build.sh
```

## Caveats

- The script removes `sccache` from the `CC` and `CXX` environment variables if the user's environment is using it as the primary linker for C/C++ compilations, since Aseprite's source code does not behave well with it.
