### ‚ùî Why?

Aseprite is a powerful tool for creating pixel art and animations, and as a hobby I've been doing pixel art for quite a while. However, building it on my MacBook was a challenging process. Thus, I've made this script which aims to simplify the build process by automating all of the steps, requiring little to no manual input.
